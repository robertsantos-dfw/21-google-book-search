## Usage 

Users will initially start on the Home page where they can initiate a search for any book. Once submitting your query a list will render from Google's Book library API. Each book listing will provide you a link to further research the book or to Save it to a list. This can be done multiple times on different books within the API's list. Switching over to the Saved Books will allow you to review Saved items and could also remove them from the list by clicking delete.
